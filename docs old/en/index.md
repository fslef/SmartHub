# :material-home-automation: SmartHub - My Connected Home

Welcome to the documentation for my **SmartHub**, my **smart home** system.

This documentation aims to share my experience in setting up a complete home automation installation, from the **network infrastructure** to daily **automations**.

While [**Home Assistant**](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is at the heart of my setup, this project is not limited to just this home automation solution. I have therefore chosen to also detail the entire ecosystem around it to provide a comprehensive and practical overview of my system.
