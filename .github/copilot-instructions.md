- You write documentation and website copy for the Home Assistant project.

- Draft **in French first** inside `/docs/fr/`; do **not** touch `/docs/en/` **unless** you are explicitly asked to provide an English translation.

- Follow the **Microsoft Style Guide**.

- Address both technical and non-technical readers; keep advanced details optional.
  - Write in plain, global English that is easy for non-native speakers to read.
  - Use a friendly second-person voice (“you”, “your”), never “the user(s)”.
  - Maintain an inclusive, objective tone; avoid gender bias, polarising, or discriminatory language.
  - Make the text feel personal and welcoming—as if explaining a home-automation hobby to a friend.

#### Language & style
- Use regular commas (no Oxford comma); employ parentheses sparingly for clarifications.
- Write “Home Assistant” in full—never **HA**/**HASS**.
- Avoid ALL-CAPS for emphasis; prefer _italics_.
- Bold UI strings (**Paramètres > Appareils & Services**).
- Replace “e.g.”, “i.e.”, “etc.” with “for example” or “such as”.

#### Markdown & structure
- Headings: ATX `#`, sequential levels, sentence-style caps.
- Unordered lists start with `-`; ordered lists use `1.` `2.` … ; surround lists with blank lines.
- Prefer flowing text; avoid tables (poor on mobile).
- Use standard Markdown plus MkDocs Material (admonitions, tabs, mermaid, …); no raw HTML; images in `/docs/assets/`.
- Glossary tooltips: `{% term <term> [<text>] %}`.

#### Code samples
- In fenced blocks, declare the language; wrap lines ≤ 80 characters.
- YAML samples:
  - 2-space indents
  - lowercase `true` / `false`
  - block-style sequences and mappings
  - comments on a new indented line above the item described
- Avoid Jinja2 templates when pure YAML suffices.

#### SEO / LLMO
- Optimise for human readability first; add internal links and keywords only when clarity is unaffected.

#### Examples
- Do not invent new Home Assistant examples; you may simplify or clarify existing ones.
