# :material-home-automation: SmartHub – My Connected Home

Welcome to the documentation of my SmartHub – a smart home automation system.

This documentation outlines how I’ve architected my home automation setup, from network infrastructure to daily automations.

## :material-lightbulb-on: Motivations

This project emerged from a home construction initiative that required a complete redesign of my future home automation system. I've been using Home Assistant since August 2021 and aimed to document this new approach to:

- Reflect on past mistakes and avoid repeating them
- Share my experience — teaching is learning twice
- Create a reference baseline for future changes and enhancements
- Contribute back to the community

## :material-magnify: Overview

The SmartHub consists of several key components:

- A secure, segmented network infrastructure
- A Docker-based deployment model for service isolation
- A Home Assistant installation with tailored automations
- Integrations with various Zigbee devices

## :material-tools: Core Technologies

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Home Assistant**: Open-source platform for centralized smart home control
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For service deployment and container isolation
- **Zigbee**: Low-power wireless communication protocol for connected devices
- **MQTT**: Lightweight messaging protocol for IoT device communication
- In consideration:
  - **Grafana & InfluxDB**: For sensor data visualization and time-series storage
  - A **security monitoring solution** to detect and respond to potential security events
